Plan: [PLAN.md](../../PLAN.md). Owner: Cedar for integration; implementation leaves are unassigned until claimed. This campaign reuses the existing speed work and the current correctness findings, without repeating landed session/allocator/hash work.

Completion: optimizing native compiler selfbuild/product rebuild, executable compilation independent of JIT invocation, correct first-generation layout and persistence, full native gate and Tender/Maki/Kestrel handoff. REPL/ordinary loader use JIT; AOT builds execute a compiled native compiler.

Speed acceptance: same pinned Tender source, all 3079 definitions counted through NCOMP, no object cache, normal checker/validators, under1.7s wall for complete optimizing load and trivial floor below500us. Report total executable-build wall including loading/capture/write alongside this target. Record source/bin IDs and actual compiler provenance. Run controlled quiet-machine before/after and per-definition pass curves; use existing Habu tools, no new measurement framework. Historical153.3→131.6s and4106→3668us used JIT-built compiler and do not prove all-AOT speed. If target still fails, keep campaign open and name measured remaining owner/pass; do not claim a projected sum.

Each leaf has source ownership, prerequisites and decisive behavior checks. Final compiler/runtime gate: rebuild exact source and `bin/hb --load test/run.f`, with every recorded failure resolved by name. Latest combined source963958d8, enginebee6aacab6734 ran318/318 suites with12 failures: effect-read-api, aot-wid-restore, aot-wide-format, pre-trust-defer, build-fixpoint-fixtures, cast, engine, engine-runtime-regressions, program-diagnostics, multi-error-api, addrmap-inline and p2-map-rewind. Provider rows, owner window, internal-call guards, symbol ceilings and debugger-resume pass. Lifecycle d90cf0a3 is integrated after that gate with ten focused checks plus independent capture/concurrency verification. Source-stage and all-tier1 target-layout paths remain active; see PLAN.md for the named findings. PTX/Loom and later cache/digest work are excluded here.
