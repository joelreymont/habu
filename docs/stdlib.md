# Standard Library

The standard library lives under `lib/`. `lib/std.manifest` is the canonical
machine-readable layout and signature index for that tree. The initial manifest
reserves module ownership only; public word rows are added only after checked
source exists.

## Layout

Planned module files:

- `lib/errors.f`
- `lib/array.f`
- `lib/string.f`
- `lib/regex.f`
- `lib/map.f`
- `lib/fs.f`
- `lib/process.f`
- `lib/argv.f`
- `lib/test.f`
- `lib/property.f`
- `lib/build.f`
- `lib/time.f`
- `lib/date.f`

Each module gets a focused test file named in the manifest and documentation in
this file. Source files stay one concern per file, and new public/library words
default to checked typed definitions.

## Manifest Format

`lib/std.manifest` is UTF-8 TSV with schema version `1` and this exact header:

```text
schema_version	module	file	kind	word	effect	test	doc	owner	status	notes
```

Columns:

- `schema_version`: currently `1`.
- `module`: lowercase stable module name.
- `file`: stable `lib/<module>.f` source path.
- `kind`: `module` or `word`.
- `word`: public word name for `word` rows; empty for `module` rows.
- `effect`: normalized checked effect for `word` rows; empty for `module` rows.
- `test`: focused test path that owns the row.
- `doc`: documentation path for the row.
- `owner`: stable ownership label for future parallel workers.
- `status`: `planned`, `active`, or `published`.
- `notes`: short human context, without tabs.

`module` rows reserve file ownership and leave `word` and `effect` empty. `word`
rows describe only public checked definitions that exist in source. The `effect`
field must match the normalized `signature` emitted by:

```sh
bin/hb /tmp/public-signatures.f lib/<module>.f
```

where `/tmp/public-signatures.f` is built from `tools/lint/lib.f` followed by
`tools/public-signatures.f`, as in `tools/stdlib-manifest-test.sh`.

Run the focused check with:

```sh
./tools/stdlib-manifest-test.sh
```
